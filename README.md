# Diploma_Megaproject_Smartcart 🛒
This is a diploma final-year project developed at Walchand College of Engineering, Sangli (2020-2021). The project proposes an IoT-based solution for automating the billing system in supermarkets using RFID technology and NodeMCU.

📌 Abstract

The project aims to simplify the customer shopping experience by integrating RFID scanning, real-time LCD billing, and WiFi communication using NodeMCU. It avoids manual billing queues and enables automatic billing at the cart level itself.

🛠 Tools and Technologies

-NodeMCU (ESP8266)
-Arduino IDE
-RFID EM-18 Reader
-LCD 16x2 with I2C module
-WiFi (ESP WebServer)
-Buzzer & LED indicators
-Proteus (for simulation)

🔁 Working Flow

->RFID detects products.
->NodeMCU updates total on LCD.
->Item removal is also handled.
->Final bill is displayed + SMS integration (via GSM module – optional).
